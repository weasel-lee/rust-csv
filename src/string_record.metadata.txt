high_level_purpose:
- Implements `StringRecord`, a UTF-8–validated CSV row type built on top of `ByteRecord`.
- Provides safe conversions between byte and string records, in-place trimming/masking, iteration, and Serde deserialization for string-oriented workflows.

core_domain_concepts:
- StringRecord: UTF-8–validated record wrapper over `ByteRecord`.
- FromUtf8Error: error that preserves the original `ByteRecord` and validation details.
- Reader integration: internal `read` helper that fills a `StringRecord` from a `Reader` with UTF-8 validation.
- FieldMask: selection bitmap forwarded to the underlying `ByteRecord` to drop fields in place (shared with `ByteRecord`).

correctness_critical_invariants_and_assumptions:
- Invariant: all fields in a `StringRecord` are valid UTF-8; methods like `get` and `trim` assume this and use unchecked UTF-8 conversion.
- Invariant: `read` clears the underlying `ByteRecord` if UTF-8 validation fails, preventing invalid UTF-8 from persisting in a `StringRecord`.
- Assumption: callers selecting `StringRecord` accept UTF-8 validation costs and failures for invalid data.
- Assumption: field masks passed to `apply_mask` are aligned with the record length; shorter masks drop trailing fields.

lifecycle_and_main_flows:
- Construction flow: create empty records, push fields, or convert from `ByteRecord` with validation.
- Reader flow: `read` pulls a byte record from a `Reader`, validates UTF-8, and returns EOF/position-aware results.
- Conversion flow: `from_byte_record_lossy` replaces invalid sequences with U+FFFD, yielding a usable `StringRecord`.
- Mutation flow: `trim` rebuilds the record while `apply_mask` compacts the underlying byte buffer in place via `ByteRecord`, updating bounds while preserving UTF-8 invariants.

edge_cases_and_tricky_behavior:
- `from_byte_record_lossy` performs a lossy replacement for invalid UTF-8, which may mask data issues.
- `trim` uses Unicode whitespace semantics (unlike `ByteRecord`, which uses ASCII), which can lead to differing behavior between record types.
- `apply_mask` inherits the `ByteRecord` behavior where out-of-range mask indices are treated as unselected, silently dropping fields.

concurrency_and_ordering_contracts:
- None; logic is effectively single-threaded and synchronous.

error_propagation_and_recovery:
- `from_byte_record` returns `FromUtf8Error` with the original record for recovery.
- `read` returns `ErrorKind::Utf8` with the original reader position on UTF-8 validation failure.
- Serde deserialization errors are surfaced via `deserialize_string_record` with optional position metadata.

design_and_responsibility_boundaries:
- This module focuses on UTF-8 safety and record ergonomics; parsing mechanics live in the reader and byte-level logic in `ByteRecord`.
- Conversion APIs (`from_byte_record`, `into_byte_record`) are key boundaries for data validation and error capture.
- Field filtering is exposed via masks passed to `apply_mask`, making masking the primary extension point for in-place mutation.

likely_bug_hotspots_and_risks:
- Risk: assuming UTF-8 validity in downstream code can lead to panics or undefined behavior if `StringRecord` invariants are violated by unsafe changes.
- Risk: lossy conversions may be misused where strict validation is required.
- Risk: in-place compaction depends on correct bounds updates in the underlying `ByteRecord`.
- Risk: mask length mismatches can silently drop fields in `apply_mask`.

refactoring_and_extension_notes:
- Preserve the invariant that `StringRecord` never contains invalid UTF-8, especially in `read` and conversion paths.
- Any new trimming or transformation APIs should clarify Unicode vs ASCII behavior and retain the in-place compaction semantics.

usage_guidance_for_future_llms:
- For code review, focus on: UTF-8 validation paths, unchecked conversions in `trim`, bounds updates in underlying byte records, and `apply_mask` selection behavior.
- For architectural review, consider: whether new data-tolerant behaviors belong here or in `ByteRecord`/reader APIs.
- For adding new features, pay particular attention to: maintaining UTF-8 invariants and error propagation with position metadata.
- When summarizing for a human, always mention: UTF-8 guarantees, conversion options (strict vs lossy), and reader integration.
