[FILE METADATA]
high_level_purpose:
- Provides narrative documentation and runnable examples for common CSV reading and writing scenarios.
- Serves as a curated index of example programs demonstrating the public API.

core_domain_concepts:
- Example workflows: basic read/write, Serde integration, delimiter configuration, and header handling.
- User guidance: links and references to example binaries in the `examples` directory.

correctness_critical_invariants_and_assumptions:
- Assumption: examples reflect the intended public API usage and are kept in sync with actual behavior.
- Invariant: documentation references example filenames and commands that should remain valid.

lifecycle_and_main_flows:
- Documentation flow: each section introduces a scenario, presents code, and shows how to run it.

edge_cases_and_tricky_behavior:
- Examples emphasize error handling via `Result` and `?`, illustrating propagation expectations rather than exhaustive error cases.

concurrency_and_ordering_contracts:
- None; documentation only.

error_propagation_and_recovery:
- Examples demonstrate standard error propagation via `Result` and explicit error printing in `main`.

design_and_responsibility_boundaries:
- This module is purely documentation; it does not implement runtime logic.

likely_bug_hotspots_and_risks:
- Risk: example code or command lines can drift from actual API behavior, leading to user confusion.

refactoring_and_extension_notes:
- Keep example lists and headings in sync with actual example files when adding or removing examples.

usage_guidance_for_future_llms:
- For code review, focus on: accuracy of example code and references to example binaries.
- For architectural review, consider: whether new features should be illustrated here for user onboarding.
- For adding new features, pay particular attention to: updating the example list and ensuring instructions remain runnable.
- When summarizing for a human, always mention: this is documentation with runnable examples for the CSV API.
