[FILE METADATA]
high_level_purpose:
- Provides an in-depth tutorial for using the CSV crate, covering reading, writing, headers, Serde, and configuration.
- Acts as narrative onboarding material for users new to the crate and to CSV parsing in Rust.

core_domain_concepts:
- Usage patterns: reader/writer construction, record iteration, deserialization/serialization, and configuration knobs.
- CSV semantics guidance: headers, delimiters, trimming, and error handling expectations in examples.

correctness_critical_invariants_and_assumptions:
- Assumption: tutorial examples and explanations stay aligned with actual API behavior and defaults.
- Invariant: documented defaults (e.g., header handling and delimiters) must match code to avoid user confusion.

lifecycle_and_main_flows:
- Documentation flow: sequential tutorial sections that build from basic reading to advanced Serde and configuration usage.

edge_cases_and_tricky_behavior:
- Tutorial highlights behavior differences (e.g., headers vs no headers) to prevent misinterpretation of record iteration results.

concurrency_and_ordering_contracts:
- None; documentation only.

error_propagation_and_recovery:
- Examples demonstrate propagating errors via `Result` and handling failures in `main`.

design_and_responsibility_boundaries:
- This module is purely documentation and does not contain runtime logic; it should mirror public API behavior.

likely_bug_hotspots_and_risks:
- Risk: documentation drift when API defaults or behaviors change can mislead users.

refactoring_and_extension_notes:
- When adding new features or changing defaults, update the tutorial to keep examples and explanations accurate.

usage_guidance_for_future_llms:
- For code review, focus on: correctness of the narrative and example alignment with API behavior.
- For architectural review, consider: whether new features require tutorial coverage to support onboarding.
- For adding new features, pay particular attention to: updating tutorial sections that describe defaults or core workflows.
- When summarizing for a human, always mention: this is the main user-facing tutorial with step-by-step examples.
