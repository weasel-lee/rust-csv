[FILE METADATA]
high_level_purpose:
- Defines the crate’s public surface (re-exports and module wiring) plus small configuration enums for CSV parsing/writing behavior.
- Provides the `invalid_option` Serde helper to intentionally treat invalid, non-empty fields as `None` instead of errors.

core_domain_concepts:
- QuoteStyle: high-level quoting policy used by writers, mapped to `csv_core` quote behavior.
- Terminator: record terminator policy (CRLF vs an explicit byte) used by readers/writers.
- Trim: whitespace trimming policy for headers and/or fields in readers.
- invalid_option: custom deserializer helper that converts invalid `Option<T>` values into `None`.

correctness_critical_invariants_and_assumptions:
- Invariant: `Trim` variants explicitly control whether headers, fields, or both are trimmed; callers rely on these for consistent parsing semantics.
- Invariant: `Terminator::CRLF` treats `\r`, `\n`, and `\r\n` as a single terminator, while `Any` uses the provided byte literally.
- Assumption: users who opt into `invalid_option` accept silent data loss for non-empty invalid fields.

lifecycle_and_main_flows:
- Configuration flow: enums (QuoteStyle/Terminator/Trim) are chosen at build time and converted to `csv_core` equivalents during reader/writer construction.
- Deserialization flow: `invalid_option` defers to `Option<T>` deserialization and coerces any error into `None`.

edge_cases_and_tricky_behavior:
- `invalid_option` suppresses all parsing errors for non-empty invalid fields, which can mask data quality issues.
- `Trim` only governs whitespace removal; it does not affect other parsing behaviors (e.g., delimiter handling).

concurrency_and_ordering_contracts:
- None; logic is effectively single-threaded and synchronous.

error_propagation_and_recovery:
- `invalid_option` deliberately converts deserialization errors into `Ok(None)` instead of propagating them.

design_and_responsibility_boundaries:
- This module centralizes public API exposure (re-exports) and lightweight configuration enums, leaving heavy parsing/serialization logic to submodules.
- `invalid_option` is an explicit opt-in extension point for tolerant parsing.

likely_bug_hotspots_and_risks:
- Risk: misuse of `invalid_option` can hide malformed data and complicate debugging.
- Risk: misunderstanding of `Trim` semantics (headers vs fields) can lead to subtle data mismatches.

refactoring_and_extension_notes:
- `#[non_exhaustive]` enums signal planned extensibility; new variants must remain backward compatible for public API.
- The module’s role as a façade means changes here can have wide API impact; prefer additive changes.

usage_guidance_for_future_llms:
- For code review, focus on: correctness of enum-to-core mappings and the intentional error suppression in `invalid_option`.
- For architectural review, consider: whether new configuration knobs belong here or in submodules.
- For adding new features, pay particular attention to: maintaining `non_exhaustive` compatibility and documenting behavior changes.
- When summarizing for a human, always mention: the crate-level configuration enums and the `invalid_option` behavior.
